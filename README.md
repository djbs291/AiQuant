## Scenario Configs

The MVP CLI can execute full scenarios via `aiquant run-config`. The supported keys and grammar are documented in `docs/ScenarioConfig.md`, and a ready-to-run example lives at `scenarios/mvp.ini` (pointing to `ticks_sample.csv`). Use these as a template when wiring new experiments.
